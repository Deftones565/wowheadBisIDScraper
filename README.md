# World of Warcraft item id
This is just a script to grab the item id's on wowhead bis lists so they can easily be copied into a macro. Made it into a very simple flask website.

## PIP
```bash
python -m pip install flask requests beautifulsoup4
```

## TODO

* Make website look nice
* The script works well enough, but could work better. It grabs all item ids on the webpage, I only want the ids in the BIS list.
